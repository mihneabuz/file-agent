# HackItAll 2022

File Agent in Node

Connects to https://github.com/mihneabuz/spring-app/tree/hackitall

Can be queried for information about file system or proccesses
Also exposes routes that can interact with the file system, create/delete/upload etc

Code is pretty bad as it was written for a 24 hour hackathon (but it works :)
